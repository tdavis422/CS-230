The Gaming Room was the client for this project. They wanted to bring their game, Draw It or Lose It, to more people by making a web-based version of their game that could also connect to the Android version of the game. I think I did pretty well with identifying the requirements and determining which OS would be best to use for development of the system. Working through a design document makes it very easy to develop the code since the document usually has all the information needed for the program. I think I would revise the Development Requirements section because I think I could've added more into that section compared to what I had entered. I interpreted the needs as the functional requirements that were specifically needed for the program to work. It is very important because if you miss a major need that the user requires, then they might not use your company ever again for software design. I approach software design with the knowledge of what is required first then add all of the non-functional requirements last since most companies want developers to build on a test server to ensure that nothing new gets pushed to production. One strategy that I like using is talking to the main person on the project to get a feel for what they are wanting their program to do.
